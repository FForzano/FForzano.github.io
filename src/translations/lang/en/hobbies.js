      description: 'I have been playing guitar since I was a child, took several years of classical and jazz lessons, and played in small groups of friends, from rock to blues. Over the years I have explored different aspects of music. During high school, I attended a mixing and studio recording course and worked as a live light technician. Later, I participated in some small events as a sound assistant. Recently, I attended a lutherie course with the idea of building a Saint Vincent-style guitar as a surprise gift.',
